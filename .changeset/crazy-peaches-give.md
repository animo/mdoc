"@animo-id/mdoc": minor
---

- Major rework of the library, primairly the underlying CBOR structures
- Includes an `Issuer`, `Holder` and `Verifier` class that should make it easier to issue, hold and verify mDocs
- More aligned with the specification, w.r.t. naming conventions
- Simplified additions/modifitcations, so adding newer features will be a lot simpler
